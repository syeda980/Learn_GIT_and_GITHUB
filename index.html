        <h3><u>What is Git?</u></h3>
        <p class="sections_p">
            So far the problem is considered one should need a platform where all the changes can be tracked. Here comes the savior

            Git is a <span style="color: rgb(35, 126, 245);"> DevOps </span> used for source code management. It is one of the most prominent version control systems (VCS) today that is widely used to handle small and large projects efficiently.Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. It helps in tracking changes in source code, enabling different people to collaborate on different parts of the same program.
        </p>
        <p class="sections_p">
            Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

            GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site in which developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.

                    git init is used to create new Repository.
                    It can be used to create a empty repository or convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository. This is typically the first command you'll perform in a new project.

                    The git config command is a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level.
                    It will modify the configuration file.Some common configuration settings like email, username, and editor  can be set on local or global level of project.

                    The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.It is a way to record versions of a project into the repository's history.
                    git add . add all the files in one go to staging area

            <p class="sections_p">
                The working directory and staging area's status are shown by the git status command. It enables you to identify which files are not being tracked by Git as well as which changes have been staged and which have not. 
                Here git status shows that there are changes in mentioned file which are not being tracked by git.

                Now after adding files, we are ready to move from stage to commit for our repository.
                Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work. Git considers each commit change point or "save point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.
                When we commit, we should always include a message.
                By adding clear messages to each commit, it is easy for yourself (and others) to see what has changed and when. To add message -m option is used.

                git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.
                The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote machine accessible supported protocols. The git clone command copies an existing Git repository.
                Here the shaded area contains the https link of your remote repository. you can copy the address from github website.

                The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository.After a local repository has been modified a push is executed to share the modifications with remote team members.
                Here git push add all the changes to remote repository.

                Using the git pull command, you may quickly update your local repository with the content you just downloaded from a remote repository. In Git-based collaboration work processes, merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a typical task.

            <h3>Branched</h3>
            <h3><u>What is branching?</u></h3>
            <p class="sections_p">
                Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems.Branching can also be done in git.Brancheds are useful when you are not sure on the changes you are going to make in the files is correct or not. Once it is confirmed that the changes are right you can link/merge that branch to the main branch that is the master branch.
                <br>
                <img src="/images/gitbranch.png" style="display:flex; height:20rem; width:50rem">
            </p>
            <p>
                The illustration depicts a repository with two separate lines of development, one for a quick feature and the other for a more involved one. The ability to work on both of them simultaneously is made possible by developing them in separate branches, which also prevents shady code from entering the main branch.
            </p>
            <p class="sections_p">
                You can use the git branch command to create, list, rename, and delete branches. It does not allow you to switch between branches or reconstruct a forked history. As a result, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.
                <br>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                    <li><b>git branch (branchName)</b></li>
                </ul>
                Here <span style="color: rgb(35, 126, 245);"> branch1 </span>is the name of the branch we have created:
            </p>

                    <li><b>git branch</b></li>
                </ul>
                Executing git branch gives you the way to know where the HEAD is pointing to. * shows the current branch.
                <br>
                <img src="/images/gitbranchName.png" style="display:flex; height:15rem; width:40rem">

                    <li><b>git checkout (branchName)</b></li>
                </ul>
                Excuting git checkout lets you switch between branches.  
                Here now HEAD points to branch2
                <br>
                <img src="/images/gitcheckout.png" style="display:flex; height:15rem; width:40rem">

                </ul>
                The git merge command combines the independent lines of development created by git branch into a single branch.
                A git merge operation is performed by running the command “git merge (name of branch to e merges)
                When we perform merging, git always merges with the current branch from where we are performing the operation.
